# BlueLock
Very lightweight app for locking your computer, when your selected Bluetooth device goes out of range.

Usage: 
- Unzip the folder with the application somewhere in your computer.
- Pair the Bluetooth device you want to use with your computer, and make sure it's visible in your Bluetooth device list.
- Run the BlueLock.exe to start the setup process. 

Requirements:
- Windows XP or higher
- Bluetooth support (often built on in laptops, for desktop computers you can use a Bluetooth dongle)

The setup is done in a console, but it is very easy, simply read and follow the instructions.
If you want to run the setup again in the future, run the BlueLock.exe with a parameter "setup" without quotes.

Unlocking your computer when the device comes back into range: This cannot be done. For security reasons, only the user can unlock the computer, once it's locked. (Well it can be done, but through some pretty hacky and ugly ways, which aren't available in BlueLock, sorry.)

Thank you for using BlueLock.
