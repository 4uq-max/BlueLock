# BlueLock
Very lightweight app for locking your computer, when your selected bluetooth device goes out of range.

Usage: 
- Unzip the folder with the application somewhere in your computer.
- Pair the bluetooth device you want to use with your computer, and make sure it's visible in your bluetooth device list.
- Run the BlueLock.exe to start the setup proccess. 

The setup is done in a console, but it is very easy, simply read and follow the instructions.
If you want to run the setup again in the future, run the BlueLock.exe with a paramter "setup" without quotes.


Thank you for using BlueLock.
